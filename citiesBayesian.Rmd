###Inputs

Given

$$Y = (Y_1, \dots, Y_i) $$
where each $Y_i$ has its own given $\sigma_{i,j}$,assume $Y \sim N(\theta_i, \sigma_{i,j})$.

### Step 1: Calculate $\theta_i, \mu, \tau^2$ using the original priors Y

$$\theta_i \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)$$

### Step 2: Pick $k$, calculate $Y'_k$

Then pick $k$ such that you get another draw, $Y'_k$ from that same fixed effects model. AKA

$$Y'_k \sim N(\theta_k, \sigma_{k,j})$$

### Step 3: Update all $Y$ values to get $Y^U$

Once those $k$ new values get calculated, update by combining to get 
$$update(Y_k, Y'_k) = Y^U_k$$

### Step 4: Use $Y^U$ to get final $\theta^U$

and once we have all the updated $Y_i^U$ we can use them to get $\theta_i^U$ based off of $\mu^U, \tau^{U2}$ with $Y^U \sim N(\theta^U_i, \sigma^U_{i,j})$
